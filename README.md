# Trading project

The main goal of our app is to predict if a share value is about to increase or decrease on the following day. 

## Companies

We will analyse the Dow Jones companies to analyze their shares patterns and give useful information to our application users. 

## Remarks

Several questions are to be taken into account :
- Which type of data is useful in this project ?
- Which threshold will we use in order to advise the user into buying/selling shares ?
- How to plot the real-time values of the companies' shares in our application ?
- Which UI framework will we choose to present the predictions ?
